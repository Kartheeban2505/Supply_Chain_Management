# Supply Chain Management

# Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing supply chain management data to optimize operations and improve efficiency. The dataset is divided into five tables covering key aspects such as product details, suppliers, inventory, logistics, and financials. Using SQL for data modeling and Power BI for visualization, the project aims to identify bottlenecks, reduce costs, and enhance decision-making. By analyzing key metrics like stock levels, shipping times, and supplier performance, actionable insights are derived to improve forecasting and streamline supply chain operations.

# Problem Statement
The supply chain management process faces several challenges, including inefficiencies in inventory management, delays in shipment, and supplier performance inconsistencies. Lack of real-time insights makes it difficult to optimize stock levels, leading to either excess inventory or stockouts. Additionally, high transportation costs and unpredictable demand fluctuations impact overall profitability. Without a structured data model and effective visualization, decision-makers struggle to identify key areas for improvement. This project aims to address these issues by leveraging SQL and Power BI to provide data-driven insights for better supply chain optimization.

# Task List
1.**Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Removed duplicate records and handled missing values.
Standardized data formats for consistency.Ensured all necessary fields were available for analysis.

2.**Database Structuring & SQL Querying:** Divided the dataset into five relational tables.
Established primary and foreign key relationships.Queried essential metrics such as inventory levels, supplier performance, and sales trends.

3.**Data Modeling in Power BI:** Defined table relationships for seamless analysis. Created calculated columns and measures using DAX (e.g., total revenue, stock levels).

4.**Dashboard Development:** Designed an interactive layout with filters for date, supplier, and product categories.Developed visualizations like trend lines, bar charts, and KPIs for key performance metrics.

5.**DAX Calculations & Insights Generation:** Created measures for revenue, inventory turnover, and supplier performance.Analyzed demand fluctuations and product performance over time.

6.**Testing and Validation:** Ensured dashboard accuracy by cross-verifying SQL query results. Checked filter functionality and slicer performance. Gathered feedback for improvements and optimizations.
